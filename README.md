# LUTs Pack: ProPhoto RGB to sRGB Color Space

When you export a photo from Lightroom® (or similiar program) into Photoshop® or any other similar photo editing program, you should go for the best quality possible by using the **ProPhoto RGB** color space (which you should use in editing process and when the photo have to be sent to a printing service).

But, when you need to publish your photo on the web, after all the editing has been done, the last step it is to convert the image to the standard **sRGB** color space, which will guarantee you that your photo will be shown pretty the same on every device.

Here comes the big problem I've met: **due to the conversion from a wide range color space to a reduced range color space, your image will lose color quality in hue, saturation, and luminance as well**.

That's the reason why I decided to try to build simple LUTs which allow me to apply few basic but important adjustments which will bring me the best possibile color matching between the two different color spaces.

## How to use the pack into Photoshop®?

Once you have loaded your photo into Photoshop, you simply need to set a new Lookup Table adjustment layer and load one of the LUTs. That's it.
